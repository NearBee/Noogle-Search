# _**Noogle Search**_

### *Description*:

Noogle search is a sample project created for Project 0 of CS50w, using HTML and CSS I was able to create a new front-end for a simple Google search, Google image search and Google advanced search.

Using the text input bar provided at the middle of the screen the user is able to make a google search using google's search engine but with a front-end that I provided.

Clicking "**Image**" at the top-right of the screen switches over to the Noogle Image Search, which is another front-end for google's image search wherein the user will provide another text input that would then use the input as a query for google's image search.

Clicking "**Advanced Search**" at the top-right of the screen will bring you to Noogle Advance Search, which takes multiple inputs being:

- "All these words"
- "This exact word or phrase"
- "Any of these words"
- "None of these words"
- "Numbers ranging from __ to __" _**etc.**_


This is all meant to be a recreation of Google's front-end for their search engine but not claiming to be anything more than a recreating.
